## Introduction

The provided exercise includes a dataset of trajectories, derived from a modified version of the Geolife GPS Trajectory dataset. Additionally, it contained code snippets for database connectivity using Python and examples of various MySQL queries. The primary objectives were to preprocess the dataset, design appropriate tables in a MySQL database, populate these tables with the cleaned data, and perform a series of queries via Python to extract meaningful insights from the database. The dataset is available here: [Geolife Trajectories 1.3](https://download.microsoft.com/download/F/4/8/F4894AA5-FDBC-481E-9285-D5F8C4C4F039/Geolife%20Trajectories%201.3.zip)

The repository can be found at [plebbimon/tdt4225](https://github.com/plebbimon/tdt4225).

## Setup

This project relies on poetry for dependency management. Once poetry is installed, we can proceed with installing the project dependencies. To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
poetry install
```

One can also enter the shell the same way as you would with any other venv:

```bash
poetry shell
```

## Usage

To insert data into the database, run the following command:

```bash
poetry run python insertion_script.py
```

To run the queries, run the following command:

```bash
poetry run python queries.py
```

## Part 1 - Insertion
So I decided to go for displaying the data using DBeaver as a visual crutch for my own sanity's sake. I've included a screenshot of the tables in the database below.

![alt text](report/activity_props.png)
![alt text](report/activity_data.png)
![alt text](report/user_props.png)
![alt text](report/user_data.png)


Data modeling wise, I've tried to map it as close as possible to the suggested format. Otherwise there's little to say in the way of the insertion script, as it's just a matter of reading the data and inserting it into the database. I've also added a few print statements to give some feedback on the progress of the script, although this might just create more confusion than it helps.

Concerning memory, I'm pretty sure that I've not made unnessecary complexity when iterating to insert the data, but there's certainly room for improvement as to how the checks are made for the relation between labeled activities and the trackpoints which don't belong to any activity.

If the code still appears to be missing bulk inserts into the db, that is probably fixed in the most recent version found in the github repo.







## Results

### Task 1:

The table shows the following results for (respectively) user_id and trajectory_count:
| Table | Rows |
|------------|---------|
| activity | 30766 |
| trackpoint | 9681756 |
| user | 182 |

Not much to say here except there seems to be a lot of trackpoints, and the activity table is relatively small compared to the trackpoint table. This is due to unlabeled activities mapping a whole trackingpoint file, which should include more than one activity for most occurrences.

### Task 2:
Average number of activities per user:

| Average activities per user |
| --------------------------- |
| 177.838                     |


### Task 3:
Top 20 users with the most activities:

| user_id | Number of activities |
| ------- | -------------------- |
| 163     | 3886                 |
| 128     | 3039                 |
| 153     | 2916                 |
| 085     | 1662                 |
| 062     | 1473                 |
| 167     | 1264                 |
| 068     | 1249                 |
| 025     | 715                  |
| 126     | 683                  |
| 084     | 591                  |
| 144     | 572                  |
| 075     | 517                  |
| 010     | 516                  |
| 052     | 482                  |
| 112     | 428                  |
| 041     | 399                  |
| 020     | 368                  |
| 179     | 362                  |
| 004     | 346                  |
| 140     | 345                  |

This seems to be correct as well, judging by the total count of activities compared to >20th user.

### Task 4:
All users who've taken a taxi:

| User |
| ---- |
| 010  |
| 020  |
| 021  |
| 052  |
| 056  |
| 058  |
| 062  |
| 065  |
| 068  |
| 075  |
| 078  |
| 080  |
| 082  |
| 084  |
| 085  |
| 091  |
| 098  |
| 100  |
| 102  |
| 104  |
| 105  |
| 111  |
| 114  |
| 118  |
| 126  |
| 128  |
| 139  |
| 147  |
| 153  |
| 154  |
| 161  |
| 163  |
| 167  |
| 175  |
| 179  |

### Task 5:

| transportation_mode | Number of activities |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| walk                | 6460                 |
| bus                 | 2853                 |
| bike                | 2089                 |
| taxi                | 1179                 |
| car                 | 993                  |
| subway              | 813                  |
| train               | 299                  |
| airplane            | 17                   |
| boat                | 7                    |
| run                 | 6                    |
| motorcycle          | 2                    |

### Task 6:

| Year | Number of activities |
| ---- | -------------------- |
| 2008 | 14739                |

2008 seems to be the year with the most activities. As we can see from the table below, it is also the year with the most hours spent on activities. I'm a bit thrown off by the year 2000 being in the mix here, which is probably due to some careless/ignorant data cleaning. The year 2000 is not a valid year for this dataset, and should be removed.

| Year | Hours   |
| ---- | ------- |
| 2007 | 4440.96 |
| 2008 | 16617   |
| 2011 | 1644.51 |
| 2009 | 14154.4 |
| 2012 | 719.884 |
| 2010 | 1725.74 |
| 2000 | 0.0511  |

### Task 7:

Total distance walked by user 112:

| User | Meters     |
|------|------------|
| 112  | 149314.532m|

149km seems like a lot, until you realize it's over such a long period. Even though, I still had to do a double take.
### Task 8:
This resulted in the slowest query I've had the displeasure of using, and I believe it's suboptimal (as in "terrible and should never be presented to anyone with sensible opinions") in some way - I just couldn't be bothered to fix it once I actually got a result in reasonable time.

|   user_id |   total_feet_gained |
|-----------|---------------------|
|       128 |         1.52967e+06 |
|       153 |         1.27025e+06 |
|       004 |    728755           |
|       085 |    606442           |
|       163 |    518639           |
|       003 |    475843           |
|       167 |    383889           |
|       084 |    378987           |
|       030 |    377285           |
|       039 |    290069           |
|       144 |    283392           |
|       062 |    245067           |
|       000 |    243650           |
|       002 |    243086           |
|       126 |    237289           |
|       041 |    225998           |
|       025 |    188351           |
|       115 |    157542           |
|       096 |    144134           |
|       028 |    136108           |

Now there's clearly some shenanigans going on here, as the total feet gained is in the millions. This is probably due to the query logic, as well as my lack of understanding of the criteria for how altitude is "gained" (as in, is it the min point vs max point, or simply the sum for all points? Then it follows that a person with tons of trackpoints in an elevator or something would have extreme numbers...).

### Task 9:

The table shows the following results for (respectively) user_id and invalid_activity_count:

---

      128                       898
      153                       585
      062                       385
      163                       265

      142                        52
      089                        51

### Task 10:
All users who've been in the Forbidden City:

|   user_id |
|-----------|
|       131 |
|       018 |
|       004 |

Now I've just rounded the numbers to the nearest three decimal points, but this could be regarded as unpresice. I'm not sure if it's a relevant problem, but I find it worth mentioning.

### Task 11:
The table shows the following results for (respectively) user_id and transportation_mode:
|   user_id | Most used transportation mode   |

Worth mentioning here that because I've sorted the transportation modes alphabetically, in tiebreakers bike will be chosen over bus, bus over car, etc.. So I've dealt with the adversity of having to choose between two equally good options by just being lazy.
